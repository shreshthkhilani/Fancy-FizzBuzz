Fancy FizzBuzz
==============

This project is for a **Ruby on Rails** class **(CIS 196)**.

Variation on the standard **FizzBuzz** in Ruby.

###Menu
When you start the program, you get a menu on the command line.
This menu allows you to run FizzBuzz, change the FizzBuzz words, or quit.

###Run FizzBuzz
The user will be asked to input a number to "FizzBuzz" until. The query will be repeated if the input isn't a number equal to or more than 1.
The program then prints all the integers from 1 to the inputted number (inclusive), but prints 
* "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3,
* "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, and
* "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 

in place of the number. 

###Change Words
This version of FizzBuzz allows you to change the words used. Replace "Fizz" and "Buzz" with any words of your choosing. If the user's input word has any whitespace, the program elminiates it. 

###Quit
The menu keeps popping up unless you quit out of it using the Quit option.
